                    <p> Who are we? We are a small company founded in 2017 in Chicago Illinois. We strive in creating efficient 
                    software that meets our all of our customers needs and wants. Our mission, Spirit, values and behavior 
                    are what separates us from other companies. We are committed to building and cultivating postive, long
                    term relationships with all our clients.  </p>

                    <hr></hr>

                    <p>  Our mission is simple: make technology an asset for your business not a problem. 
                        Too many times we have seen other IT consulting firms recommend solutions that are not appropriate for 
                        the specific client’s business or will not take a business’ operations into their planning as they routinely 
                        bring down an entire business while they perform routine maintenance on a server. That is unacceptable. 
                        We won’t bring you down in the middle of the day because it is “a better time for us”. We work around your business. 
                        We strive to make technology integrate seamlessly with your business so your business can grow. As your technology partner, 
                        when your business grows ours will grow with you, therefore, we will work hand in hand with you to support your growth.
                    </p>
